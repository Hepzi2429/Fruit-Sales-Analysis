# Fruit-Sales-Analysis-Project

This project demonstrates building a comprehensive Power BI report for analyzing fruit sales data using advanced data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations.

## Project Summary

The goal is to create a dynamic and insightful sales report that enables users to explore data by customers, stores, and time periods. The report includes clean visuals, slicers for filtering, bookmarks for quick views, and advanced DAX calculations such as running totals and year-to-date sales.

## What You Will Learn

### Data Modeling & Cleaning
- Understand and implement a **Snowflake Schema** data model to efficiently organize sales data.
- Clean and transform raw data for accurate reporting.
- Create and format a clear **line chart** visualizing sales trends.

### Interactive Filtering
- Add and format a **Customer Name slicer** to enable user-driven filtering.
- Incorporate additional slicers for other dimensions (e.g., date, product) to enhance interactivity.
- Apply slicer formatting for a clean user interface.

### Bookmarking & Navigation
- Add bookmarks to focus on key insights, such as **average sales** for quick report navigation.

### Advanced DAX Measures
- Use **SUM** measure to aggregate sales values effectively.
- Create a **Running Total** measure to show cumulative sales over time.
- Define a **Year-to-Date (YTD)** sales measure for performance tracking.

### Visual Analysis
- Add charts to highlight the **Top 5 stores** and **Bottom 5 customers** by sales, supporting decision-making.
